# Library-Database-Management-System
The objective of this project is to design and implement a database management system for a public library. The system will help the library staff manage their resources, including books, magazines, digital media, and other materials. Additionally, it will provide efficient access to library membersâ€™ information and facilitate borrowing and tracking of library materials. The library management system should ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy for both library staff and members.
